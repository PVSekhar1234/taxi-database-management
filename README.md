# Taxi Database Management
## Problem Description
The growing economy and the information age have arrived. The life of a variety of information tends to be digital and clear. Taxi management systems are born in such an environment, the increasingly developed traffic, taxi information is complicated.
So Companies will require a huge computer storage space, high-performance processing power, highly reliable data security, clear visual data and other advantages.
to assist the management of the taxi management, to achieve a reasonable use of computer resources, and truly the purpose of reducing the labor force to improve the quality of labor.

For managing such a large data they would require a proper data management system, with data security and less data redundancy. 

The Major Steps  of our project included the following: 
- Analyzing the demand situation
- Making the ER diagram(Creating Strong and Weak Entities) 
- Planning the data flow (modeling the relations between entities ) 
- Planning about various features that our website will have
- Learning the required tech-stack for our project
- Writing frontend and backend.

The goal of this project is to use MySQL to develop a set of applications in the transport
industry on the taxi management Database system. The application system will be mainly through the taxi information management system so that it becomes much easier for the customer to book a taxi and for drivers to find customers at the same time. Attempt to provide some features better than current leading taxi booking companies.

## Techstack and Libraries Used:
### Node.js : 
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows us to run JavaScript on the server and is used for server-side programming, primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional websites and back-end API services.
### Express.js: 
Express. js is a framework based on Node. js which is used for building web-application using approaches and principles of Node. js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
### Leaflet API:						
Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. Through it, we can provide web maps, search and popups, and layers switching controls
### MYSQL:
MySQL is used as a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is free and open-source. Moreover, it is also useful for both small and large applications, ours being a small one currently.
### EJS: 
EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) is one of the most popular template engines for JavaScript. As the name suggests, it lets us embed JavaScript code in a template language that is then used to generate HTML. It retains the syntax of HTML while allowing data interpolation.
### Tailwind CSS:
Tailwind CSS is a "utility-first CSS framework" which provides several opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup to design an element.
### BCRYPT: 
Bcrypt is used as a  password-hashing function for storing the passwords of our users.This algorithm handles passwords up to 72 characters.
### Cloudinary:
Cloudinary is an end-to-end image and video management solution for websites and mobile apps, covering everything from image and video uploads, storage, manipulations, and optimizations to delivery. Used for storing images of users.
